## Description:
````
We want to help people with food restrictions and allergies feel more comfortable at the grocery store. 
Look for products that are labeled as "gluten-free," "dairy-free," "soy-free," or "peanut-free." These products are typically safe for people with food restrictions and allergies.
You can search for food products according to diatery restrictions like badges, fat, protein, carbs and calories.
View Foods according to diatery: Users should be able to view items by photos, videos, descriptions, and information about the product they will utimately choose from.
Eventually a meal plan will be choosen according to diatery restriction.
